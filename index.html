            <p>We'll paint one happy little tree right here. We can fix anything. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. It's a good way of getting rid of all your anxieties and hostilities. A big strong tree needs big strong roots.

                Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. You don't want to kill all your dark areas they are very important. A beautiful little sunset. I think there's an artist hidden in the bottom of every single one of us. You can create beautiful things - but you have to see them in your mind first.
                
                Any little thing can be your friend if you let it be. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It takes dark in order to show light. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator.
                
                Mix your color marbly don't mix it dead. If you don't think every day is a good day - try missing a few. You'll see. It's all a game of angles.
                
                Let that brush dance around there and play. Maybe he has a little friend that lives right over here. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world.
                
                Go out on a limb - that's where the fruit is. Fluff that up. There we are. Play with the angles.
                
                And I will hypnotize that just a little bit. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. We'll put a happy little bush here. We need a shadow side and a highlight side. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power.
                The only thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. There we go. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good.

                Once you learn the technique, ohhh! Turn you loose on the world; you become a tiger. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. I get carried away with this brush cleaning. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. Play with the angles. Learn when to stop.
                
                You have to make these big decisions. Now then, let's play. If you didn't have baby clouds, you wouldn't have big clouds. Take your time. Speed will come later. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping.
                
                Remember how free clouds are. They just lay around in the sky all day long. I'm gonna start with a little Alizarin crimson and a touch of Prussian blue We'll do another happy little painting. Let the paint work. That easy. Just pretend you are a whisper floating across a mountain.
                
                Everybody needs a friend. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. You can do anything here. So don't worry about it. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to Washington. Let's get wild today.
                
                Now it's beginning to make a little sense. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. It takes dark in order to show light. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. Be so very light. Be a gentle whisper.
                
                Son of a gun. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. This is the time to get out all your flustrations, much better than kicking the dog around the house or taking it out on your spouse. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder.</p>
